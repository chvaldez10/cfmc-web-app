Parse this liturgy text file into a structured JSON format with the following requirements:

1. JSON Structure:
{
  "liturgy": [
    { 
      "header": str,
      "indicationToStand": bool,
      "personIncharge": str,
      "content": str/object 
    }
  ]
}

2. Parsing Guidelines:
- A header is the section or item in the worship service
- "indicationToStand" is true if there's a * before the header
- "personIncharge" is the individual or group responsible for that part
- "content" can be:
  - A simple string description
  - A detailed object for songs (with title, lyrics, etc.)
  - Left blank if no specific content exists

3. Handling Messy Data:
- Be flexible with incomplete or inconsistent information
- If unsure about a field, leave it blank or use best judgment
- Prioritize capturing the essence of the liturgy

4. Lyrics Handling:
- For public domain hymns, include full lyrics
- For copyrighted songs, include minimal details
- Preserve original formatting and line breaks

Please parse the entire text, capturing as much detail as possible while maintaining the specified JSON structure.
