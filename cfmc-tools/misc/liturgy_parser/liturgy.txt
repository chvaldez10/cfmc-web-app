*Hymn of Discipleship  OGRP#162  “O Come, O Come Emmanuel”        Unison

O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here, until the Son of God appear.
o	Refrain:
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
O come, Thou Wisdom from on high, who orders all things mightily;
To us the path of knowledge show, and teach us in its ways to go.
O come, Thou Branch of Jesse’s stem, unto Thine own and rescue them!
From depths of hell Thy people save, and give them vict’ry o’er the grave.
O come, Thou Key of David, come and open wide our heav’nly home;
Make safe for us the heav’n ward road, and bar the way to death’s abode.
O come, Thou Bright and Morning Star, and bring us comfort from afar!
Dispel the shadows of the night and turn our darkness into light.
O come, Desire of nations, bind in one the hearts of all mankind;
Bid all our sad divisions cease, and be Thyself our King of Peace.
Sending Forth
