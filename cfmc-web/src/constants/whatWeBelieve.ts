      "Our Lord Jesus Christ is truly God who humbled himself, became truly human without ceasing to be God, for our salvation. He is the eternal Son of God, was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the Virgin Mary. He lived a perfect life, suffered, was crucified, died, and was buried on our behalf, and took upon himself the just punishment for our sins. On the third day, he victoriously rose from the dead and ascended into Heaven, sits and reigns at the right hand of God the Father, and will imminently return to judge all people on that appointed Day.

      "The Bible is God's written Word, uniquely inspired by the Holy Spirit. It has both divine authorship (God) and human instrumentality (human authors), written in human languages, guided by the Holy Spirit, and can be understood by humans like us. The Bible as God's Word has final authority over all human life. The Old Testament (39 books) is not contrary to the New Testament (27 books). The New Testament fulfills and interprets the Old Testament. The Bible, as a complete revelation of God, essentially and sufficiently bears witness to God's salvation in Christ and clearly speaks of God's will for His people. The Holy Spirit who inspired the writers is the same Spirit that preserves and protects the transmission and translation of the Bible, as well as illuminating the reading, preaching, and teaching of it by the Christian community. Bible references: Authority - Deuteronomy 4:2; 28:9; Psalm 19:7-11; John 14:26; 17:17; Romans 15:4; II Timothy 3:14-17; Hebrews 4:12; James 1:21. Authority of the Old Testament - Matthew 5:17-18; Luke 10:25-28; John 5:39,46-47; Acts 10:43; Galatians 5:3-4; I Peter 1:10-12. Authority of the New Testament - Matthew 24:35; Mark 8:38; John 14:24; Hebrews 2:1-4; II Peter 1:16-21; I John 2:2-6; Revelation 21:5; 22:19.",
